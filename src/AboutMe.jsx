    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <Container>
    <p>
    I am a former Operations Manager accustomed to working in fast paced team environments looking for a complete career change. I've always enjoyed being creative when it comes to solving complex problems, and after doing a few online courses I realised becoming a software engineer would enable me to continue following my passion. After embarking on a Full Stack General Assembly course, I’m now looking to combine my customer centric mentality with my knowledge and passion for solving problems, to become a well rounded software engineer. I am looking to join a vibrant team that would help me develop my skills and enable me to keep learning.
   I love working alongside other people and bouncing ideas off of each other. I can’t wait to get started and continue learning!

      <h4>Interests</h4>
      <p>Outside of work, I’m really passionate about animal welfare; I recently flew over and rehomed a blind kitten from Cyprus who could’ve sadly had a completely different fate. It’s mine and my wife’s dream to one day rescue all of the cats there! Aside from animals, I’m really into fitness, and in particular olympic weightlifting; during my time being furloughed (COVID) I undertook a strength and conditioning course simply because I loved it. Becoming a dad recently, I am also finding myself enjoying nostalgic kids TV like Sesame Street and dare I admit, Teletubbies! </p>
